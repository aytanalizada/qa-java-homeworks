    // Task 8: Determine Days in Month
    // Instruction: Write a program that takes user input for a month number (1-12) and prints the number of days in that month. For February, print "28 or 29 days." Print "Invalid month" if the number is outside this range.
    // Expected Result: If the user input month is 2, the output should be "28 or 29 days."

    // Task 9: Check Temperature
    // Instruction: Write a program that takes user input for the temperature and prints a message based on the following conditions: Below 0: "Freezing", 0-10: "Very Cold", 11-20: "Cold", 21-30: "Warm", Above 30: "Hot".
    // Expected Result: If the user input temperature is 25, the output should be "Warm."

    // Task 10: Convert Number to Word
    // Instruction: Write a program that takes user input for a number (1-5) and prints the corresponding word in English (1 for "One", 2 for "Two", etc.). Print "Invalid number" if the number is outside this range.
    // Expected Result: If the user input number is 3, the output should be "Three."
    public static void convertNumberToWord() {
        // Implementation here

    // Task 11: Switch String Input
    // Instruction: Write a program that takes user input for a string and prints "A" if the input is "aaaa", "B" if the input is "bbbb", and "C" if the input is "cccc". Print "Invalid input" for any other string.
    // Expected Result: If the user input is "aaaa", the output should be "A."
